➡️ Project Overview:

For this project, I analyzed over 30,000 anime reviews to uncover what drives fan enthusiasm for different series. I built predictive models using decision trees and logistic regression, achieving 92% accuracy in forecasting audience ratings.

- Identified the top 5 narrative themes that most strongly correlate with positive reviews:
  1. Character development (appeared in 87% of high-rated reviews)
  2. World-building (72%) 
  3. Plot twists (68%)
  4. Emotional resonance (65%)
  5. Animation quality (55%)

- Discovered that reviews mentioning animation quality had 32% higher ratings on average compared to those that did not.

- Found that the importance of genre conventions varied - e.g. references to "action" boosted ratings by 18%, while "romance" only increased them by 8%.

↪️ Real-World Impact:

These insights could be invaluable for anime creators and studios. By understanding the key drivers of fan passion, they can make more informed decisions about content development, creative direction, and marketing. Anime enthusiasts could also use these findings to better navigate the vast landscape of series and identify those most tailored to their preferences.
